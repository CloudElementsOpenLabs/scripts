# Scripts
This is a repo of scripts that can be used to perform specific tasks within Cloud Elements. If you would like to contribute, please name your repo with pascal casing (PascalCasing) and include
a Readme file, your script (we welcome all programming languages!), and any supporting files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc). Please remember to include a .gitignore as well.
